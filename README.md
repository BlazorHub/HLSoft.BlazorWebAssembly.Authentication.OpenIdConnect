# HLSoft.BlazorWebAssembly.Authentication.OpenIdConnect
This is an OpenIdConnect library for Blazor WebAssembly base on oidc-client-js (https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js). Actually, this library is a brief wrapper of oidc-client-js, created to make our life with Blazor WebAssembly Client easier, only minimum configuration, minimum code, no javascript. Sound good?
